#  Control Theory for Autonomous Systems â€“ Mathematical Modeling, Simulation & Feedback Design

This repository contains a structured portfolio of assignments completed as part of my coursework and self-study in **Control Theory**, with a focus on real-world applications such as **autonomous vehicles** and **robotic systems**.

From modeling differential equations to designing robust controllers and simulating closed-loop behavior, this collection reflects my skills in **state-space modeling**, **control synthesis**, **observer design**, and **discrete control** â€” all implemented in **Python from scratch**, using symbolic and numerical methods.
